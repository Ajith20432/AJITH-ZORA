"""
brain.py — the "auto-learning brain".

What it actually does: it adjusts HOW MUCH the strategy trusts each expert
(15m/1h/4h technical timeframes, plus the optional "ai" and "news" experts)
and each technical factor (trend/momentum/rsi/mean-reversion/volume/chart
patterns), based
on whether trades that leaned on them actually turned out to be winners or
losers. Over time, experts/factors that have been reliable get more say in
future signals; ones that have been misleading get less.

Design choices, and why:
- This is a simple, auditable "multiplicative weights" (Hedge-style) online
  learning rule, not a deep neural net — it runs fine on a phone with no
  heavy ML dependencies, and the learned weights are always human-readable
  JSON you can open and inspect.
- Weights are clamped (never zero, never dominant) so the brain can adapt
  but can't collapse onto a single factor after a lucky/unlucky streak.
- IMPORTANT: this only changes which SIGNAL gets generated. It has no
  access to position sizing, stop distance, or the kill switches — those
  live in risk.py and the brain cannot touch them. Learning can make the
  bot's opinions better calibrated; it can never make it take bigger risks.
