"""
strategy.py — multi-timeframe, multi-factor signal engine.

Several independent experts are scored separately, then combined using
weights supplied by brain.py's auto-learning brain — which adjusts those
weights over time based on which experts have actually been right:
  - three technical experts: 15m / 1h / 4h candles, each scored on
    trend / momentum / rsi / mean-reversion / volume / chart patterns
  - one optional "ai" expert: the consensus of whichever free/paid LLM
    APIs are configured in .env (see multi_ai.py)
  - one optional "news" expert: keyword-sentiment lean across recent
    headlines mentioning the traded coin (see news_feed.py)

This keeps the "multiple specialist agents + coordinator" idea from the
original design, but as transparent, auditable code — the AI panel is
just one more voice the brain learns to weigh, never a special override.

Every function here takes an optional `brain` parameter, defaulting to the
production BRAIN singleton — pass an isolated AdaptiveBrain(state_path=...)
in tests so they never read or write the real brain_state.json.
